# To-DO
- **SORT BY**
  - Distance
  - Timeline
    - Date Range Picker (Like when booking a hotel)
- Website/Facebook links and make sure all info is up to date
  - Make the name clickable to go to the website?
- Make upcomingRaces only go 3 months ahead
  - (If I start putting next years races in then technically everything will be upcoming)
- Add "No Results Found" when search returns null
- Footer
  - Name and Contact Info
- Navbar Styling
- Overall Styling
- Security
- Domain Name

## Future Functionality in order of complexity
- Fuse.js Fuzzy Search
- Regisitration open visual indicator based on registration dates
  - Could also be a home page item
  - Depends on strict registration open dates which are rare rn.
- Maps
  - New page that shows all races on a map and when the route is clicked on it shows minimal info and expand button.
- Login / Profiles
  - Favorites that pin to home page
  - Add countdown to home page for selected race
